# Handwritten Digits Generation Using GAN

This repository contains an implementation of Handwritten_Digits_Generation_Using_GAN from scratch using the Keras deep learning framework. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, that compete against each other in a game to improve the quality of generated data. In this project, I will create a GAN to generate realistic-looking handwritten digits resembling the ones in the MNIST dataset.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning models that have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data samples. In this project, I aim to create a GAN model to generate handwritten digits similar to the ones found in the MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark in the field of computer vision and machine learning.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib (for visualizing the generated images)

## Dataset

- Dataset used [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) dataset.
- The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.

- The dataset is originally taken from source: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
- Four files are available on this site:

1. train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz:  training set images (9912422 bytes)
2. train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz:  training set labels (28881 bytes)
3. t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz:   test set images (1648877 bytes)
4. t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz:   test set labels (4542 bytes)
  
## Results

Here are some example images generated by the GAN:

These images were generated after training the model for 50 epochs. You can further improve the quality of generated digits by training for more epochs or experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
